## Caught a Bug?

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Link the package to the global module directory: `yarn run link` (not `yarn link`)
3. You can now start using `now` anywhere inside the command line

As always, you should use `yarn test` to run the tests and see if your changes have broken anything.
