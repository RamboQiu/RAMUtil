```
USAGE
  $ apollo client:codegen [OUTPUT]

ARGUMENTS
  OUTPUT

      file or directory (absolute or relative to the current working directory) to which:
         - a file will be written for each query (if "output" is a directory)
         - all generated types will be written
      - For all other types, this defines a file (absolute or relative to the current working directory) to which all 
      generated types are written.

## `apollo plugins`

list installed plugins

```
USAGE
  $ apollo plugins

OPTIONS
  --core  show core plugins

EXAMPLE
  $ apollo plugins
```

_See code: [@oclif/plugin-plugins](https://github.com/oclif/plugin-plugins/blob/v1.7.3/src/commands/plugins/index.ts)_

  $ apollo plugins:install PLUGIN...

ARGUMENTS
  PLUGIN  plugin to install

OPTIONS
  -h, --help     show CLI help
  -v, --verbose

DESCRIPTION
  Can be installed from npm or a git url.

  Installation of a user-installed plugin will override a core plugin.

  e.g. If you have a core plugin that has a 'hello' command, installing a user-installed plugin with a 'hello' command 
  will override the core plugin implementation. This is useful if a user needs to update core plugin functionality in 
  the CLI without the need to patch and update the whole CLI.

ALIASES
  $ apollo plugins:add

EXAMPLES
  $ apollo plugins:install myplugin 
  $ apollo plugins:install https://github.com/someuser/someplugin
  $ apollo plugins:install someuser/someplugin
```

## `apollo plugins:link PLUGIN`

links a plugin into the CLI for development

```
USAGE
  $ apollo plugins:link PLUGIN

ARGUMENTS
  PATH  [default: .] path to plugin

OPTIONS

  -v, --verbose

DESCRIPTION
  Installation of a linked plugin will override a user-installed or core plugin.

  e.g. If you have a user-installed or core plugin that has a 'hello' command, installing a linked plugin with a 'hello' 
  command will override the user-installed or core plugin implementation. This is useful for development work.

EXAMPLE
  $ apollo plugins:link myplugin

# Configuration

The Apollo CLI and VS Code extension can be configured with an Apollo Config file. Apollo configuration is stored as a plain object and can be either specified under the `apollo` key in your `package.json` or as a separate `apollo.config.js` which exports the config data.

Let's take a look at a basic configuration file (`apollo.config.js` style):

```js
module.exports = {
  client: {
    name: "My Client Project",
    service: "my-service-name"
  }
}
```

## Client settings

### Service Configuration

When linking a client to a service, you can either use the name of a service that has been published to the Apollo service registry, or you can use a remote url that supports introspection or you can provide a filepath of a generated SDL (Schema Definition Language) file, for example: `schema.json` or `schema.graphql`.

```js
module.exports = {
  client: {
    service: "my-service-name",

    // or
    service: {
      name: "my-service-name",
      url: "http://example.com/graphql",
      headers: {
        cookie: "myCookieValue"
      }
    },

    // or a local generated schema file
    service: {
      name: "my-service-name",
      localSchemaFile: "./path/to/schema.graphl"
    }
  }
};
```

## Service settings

The service config needs to know how to fetch the schema for that service. This can be done with either an endpoint config or a filepath of a generated SDL (Schema Definition Language) file, for example: `schema.json` or `schema.graphql`.

```js
module.exports = {
  service: {
    name: "my-service",

    // this is the default endpoint info
    endpoint: {
      url: "https://localhost:4000/graphql"
    },

    // or a local generated schema file
    localSchemaFile: "./path/to/schema.graphl"
  }
};
```

# Code Generation

## Accompanying Libraries

See [Apollo iOS](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios) for details on the mapping from GraphQL results to Swift types, as well as runtime support for executing queries and mutations. For Scala, see [React Apollo Scala.js](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo-scalajs) for details on how to use generated Scala code in a Scala.js app with Apollo Client.

## `gql` template support

If the source file for generation is a JavaScript or TypeScript file, the codegen will try to extrapolate the queries inside the [gql tag](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag) templates.

The tag name is configurable using the CLI `--tagName` option.

## Typescript and Flow

When using the codegen command with Typescript or Flow, make sure to add the `__typename` introspection field to every selection set within your graphql operations.

If you're using a client like `apollo-client` that does this automatically for your GraphQL operations, pass in the `--addTypename` option to `apollo codegen:generate` to make sure the generated Typescript and Flow types have the `__typename` field as well. This is required to ensure proper type generation support for `GraphQLUnionType` and `GraphQLInterfaceType` fields.

## Why is the \_\_typename field required?

Using the type information from the GraphQL schema, we can infer the possible types for fields. However, in the case of a `GraphQLUnionType` or `GraphQLInterfaceType`, there are multiple types that are possible for that field. This is best modeled using a disjoint union with the `__typename`
as the discriminant.

For example, given a schema:

```graphql
...

interface Character {
  name: String!
}

type Human implements Character {
  homePlanet: String
}

type Droid implements Character {
  primaryFunction: String
}

...
````

Whenever a field of type `Character` is encountered, it could be either a Human or Droid. Human and Droid objects
will have a different set of fields. Within your application code, when interacting with a `Character` you'll want to make sure to handle both of these cases.

Given this query:

```graphql
query Characters {
  characters(episode: NEW_HOPE) {
    name

    ... on Human {
      homePlanet
    }

    ... on Droid {
      primaryFunction
    }
  }
}
```

Apollo Codegen will generate a union type for Character.

```javascript
export type CharactersQuery = {
  characters: Array<
    | {
        __typename: "Human",
        name: string,
        homePlanet: ?string
      }
    | {
        __typename: "Droid",
        name: string,
        primaryFunction: ?string
      }
  >
};
```

This type can then be used as follows to ensure that all possible types are handled:

```javascript
function CharacterFigures({ characters }: CharactersQuery) {
  return characters.map(character => {
    switch (character.__typename) {
      case "Human":
        return (
          <HumanFigure
            homePlanet={character.homePlanet}
            name={character.name}
          />
        );
      case "Droid":
        return (
          <DroidFigure
            primaryFunction={character.primaryFunction}
            name={character.name}
          />
        );
    }
  });
}
```

[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/apollographql/apollo-tooling.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/apollographql/apollo-tooling)

This repo is composed of multiple packages managed by Lerna. The `apollo-cli` contains the core CLI commands. The `apollo-codegen-core` package contains all the compiler APIs needed to implement code generation support for new languages. The other `apollo-codegen-*` packages implement code generation support for individual languages.

Running tests locally:

```
npm install
npm test
```

You can also run `npm` commands within package folders after you have bootstrapped the repository (part of `npm install`).

## Nock tests

To display the debugging messages for nock, run the following command:

```bash
DEBUG=nock.* npm test
```

It can also be helpful to print standard out during testing. To enable logging, add the following configuration to the `stdout` function call during test creation:

```
.stdout({ print: true })
```

## Publishing

- Make sure you have a `GITHUB_AUTH` set in your environment variables. For more information on setting `GITHUB_AUTH`, check the [`lerna-changelog` documentation](https://github.com/lerna/lerna-changelog#github-token).
- In the root of the repository, run `npx lerna-changelog` (PR labels are read automatically using the `GITHUB_AUTH` token).
- Copy the result into the `CHANGELOG.md` file and replace the top line with the CLI version that will be published.
- Run `git add CHANGELOG.md` so that the update will be included in Lerna's "publish" commit.
- If the `CHANGELOG.md` is still missing included changes, please manually add those changes.
- Finally, run `npm run release` to publish the individual packages.
